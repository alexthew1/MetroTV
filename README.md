3.  **Configure:** Add your M3U playlist URL and XMLTV EPG link in the settings tab to begin watching.

## Roadmap 

I am constantly working to transform MetroTV into a complete media hub but alas I am solely a single developer and a bad one at that but here are the features that I really want to add later down the line:

### 🎥 VOD & Media Center
* **Movies & TV Categories:** Dedicated sections for non-live content.
* **IMDb Metadata Scraping:** Automatic fetching of posters, ratings, and plot summaries via IMDb integration.
* **Music Library:** A dedicated music category with full metadata support (including FLAC/MP4) for local and remote audio streams.

### 🎮 Input & Accessibility
* **Controller Support:** Full navigation support for Xbox and generic gamepads.
* **Remote Control Integration:** Support for Windows PC compatiable TV remotes and keyboard-only navigation for HTPC setups.

### 📱 Future Platforms
* **Mobile Ports:** A planned port using **React Native** to bring the MetroTV experience to Android and Android TV devices. *(Note: Research phase; requires rewriting large chunks of the code).*
